# LeagueSummonerSearch
Project using Riot Games API to find and display profile data such as level, icon, and highest rank.


It is my first Project using React, Axios, and data from an API.


This site only works with North American League Accounts. Searching up other regions will not give data at the moment. 

If you are in the North American server for league then you are able to look at your ranked solo/duo data, ranked flex data, top 6 highest mastery champions, and last time you played the champion.
